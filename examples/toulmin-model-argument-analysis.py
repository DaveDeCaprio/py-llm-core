Varying Definitions of Online Communication and
Their Effects on Relationship Research
Elizabeth L. Angeli

Abstract

This paper explores four published articles that report on results from research conducted
on online (Internet) and offline (non-Internet) relationships and their relationship to
computer-mediated communication (CMC). The articles, however, vary in their
definitions and uses of CMC. Butler and Kraut (2002) suggest that face-to-face (FtF)
interactions are more effective than CMC, defined and used as “email,” in creating
feelings of closeness or intimacy. Other articles define CMC differently and, therefore,
offer different results. This paper examines Cummings, Butler, and Kraut’s (2002)
research in relation to three other research articles to suggest that all forms of CMC
should be studied in order to fully understand how CMC influences online and offline
relationships.


Numerous studies have been conducted on various facets of Internet
relationships, focusing on the levels of intimacy, closeness, different communication
modalities, and the frequency of use of computer-mediated communication (CMC).
However, contradictory results are suggested within this research mostly because only
certain aspects of CMC are investigated, for example, email only. Cummings, Butler,
and Kraut (2002) suggest that FtF interactions are more effective than CMC (read:
email) in creating feelings of closeness or intimacy, while other studies suggest the
opposite. In order to understand how both online (Internet) and offline (non-Internet)
relationships areaffected by CMC, all forms of CMC should be studied. This paper
examines Cummingset al.’s research against other CMC research to propose that
additional research beconducted to better understand how online communication effects
relationships.


Literature Review

In Cummings et al.’s (2002) summary article reviewing three empirical studies on
online social relationships, it was found that CMC, especially email, was less effective
than FtF contact in creating and maintaining close social relationships. Two of the three
reviewed studies focusing on communication in non-Internet and Internet relationships
mediated by FtF, phone, or email modalities found that the frequency of each modality’s
use was significantly linked to the strength of the particular relationship (Cummings et
al., 2002). The strength of the relationship was predicted best by FtF and phone
communication, as participants rated email as an inferior means of maintaining personal
relationships as compared to FtF and phone contacts (Cummings et al., 2002).

Cummings et al. (2002) reviewed an additional study conducted in 1999 by the
HomeNet project. In this project, Kraut, Mukhopadhyay, Szczypula, Kiesler, and
Scherlis(1999) compared the value of using CMC and non-CMC to maintain
relationships withpartners. They found that participants corresponded less frequently
with their Internetpartner (5.2 times per month) than with their non-Internet partner (7.2
times per month)(as cited in Cummings et al., 2002). This difference does not seem
significant, as it isonly two times less per month. However, in additional self-report
surveys, participantsresponded feeling more distant, or less intimate, towards their
Internet partner than theirnon-Internet partner. This finding may be attributed to
participants’ beliefs that email isan inferior mode of personal relationship
communication.

Intimacy is necessary in the creation and maintenance of relationships, as it is
defined as the sharing of a person’s innermost being with another person, i.e.,
selfdisclosure(Hu, Wood, Smith, & Westbrook, 2004). Relationships are facilitated by
thereciprocal self-disclosing between partners, regardless of non-CMC or CMC.
Cummingset al.’s (2002) reviewed results contradict other studies that research the
connectionbetween intimacy and relationships through CMC.

Hu et al. (2004) studied the relationship between the frequency of Instant
Messenger (IM) use and the degree of perceived intimacy among friends. The use of IM
instead of email as a CMC modality was studied because IM supports a nonprofessional
environment favoring intimate exchanges (Hu et al., 2004). Their results suggest that apositive relationship exists between the frequency of IM use and intimacy,
demonstrating that participants feel closer to their Internet partner as time progresses through this CMC modality.

Similarly, Underwood and Findlay (2004) studied the effect of Internet relationships on primary, specifically non-Internet relationships and the perceived intimacy of both. In this study, self-disclosure, referred to "whether [participants] shared secrets, discussed personal problems, or had discussed sexual preferences" (p. 131). Participants reported significantly higher self-disclosure in their Internet relationship than in their primary relationship. In contrast, the participants’ primary relationships were reported as highly self-disclosed in the past, but the current level of disclosure was perceived to be lower (Underwood & Findlay, 2004). This result suggests participants turned to the Internet in order to fulfill the need for intimacy in their lives.

In further support of this finding, Tidwell and Walther (2002) hypothesized CMC participants employ deeper self-disclosures than FtF participants in order to overcome the limitations of CMC, e.g., the reliance on nonverbal cues. It was found that CMC partners engaged in more frequent intimate questions and disclosures than FtF partners in order to overcome the barriers of CMC. In their study, Tidwell and Walther (2002) measured the perception of a relationship’s intimacy by the partner of each participant in both the CMC and FtF conditions. The researchers found that the participants’ partners stated their CMC partner was more effective in employing more intimate exchanges than their FtF partner, and both participants and their partners rated their CMC relationship as more intimate than their FtF relationship.


Discussion


Cummings et al. (2002) argued that the evidence from their research conflicted with other data examining the effectiveness of online social relationships. This statement
is supported by the aforementioned discussion of other research. There may be a few possible theoretical explanations for these discrepancies.


Limitations of These Studies


The discrepancies identified may result from a number of limitations found in the materials reviewed by Cummings et al. (2002). These can result from technological constraints, demographic factors, or issues of modality. Each of these limitations will be examined in further detail below.


Technological limitations

First, one reviewed study by Cummings et al. (2002) examined only email correspondence for their CMC modality. Therefore, the study is limited to only one mode of communication among other alternatives, e.g., IM as studied by Hu et al. (2004). Because of its many personalized features, IM provides more personal CMC. For example, it is in real time without delay, voice-chat and video features are available for many IM programs, and text boxes can be personalized with the user’s picture, favorite colors and text, and a wide variety of emoticons, e.g., :). These options allow for both an increase in self-expression and the ability to overcompensate for the barriers of CMC through customizable features, as stated in Tidwell and Walther (2002). Self-disclosure and intimacy may result from IM’s individualized features, which are not as personalized in email correspondence.



Demographic limitations

In addition to the limitations of email, Cummings et al. (2002) reviewed studies that focused on international bank employees and college students (see Appendix B for demographic information). It is possible the participants’ CMC through email was used primarily for business, professional, and school matters and not for relationship creation or maintenance. In this case, personal self-disclosure and intimacy levels are expected to be lower for non-relationship interactions, as this communication is primarily between boss and employee or student and professor. Intimacy is not required, or even desired, for these professional relationships.


Modality limitations.


Instead of professional correspondence, however, Cummings et al.’s (2002) review of the HomeNet project prioritized already-established relationships and CMC’s effect on relationship maintenance. The HomeNet researchers’ sole dependence on email communication as CMC may have contributed to the lower levels of intimacy and closeness among Internet relationships as compared to non-Internet relationships (as cited in Cummings et al., 2002). The barriers of non- personal communication in email could be a factor in this project, and this could lead to less intimacy among these Internet partners. If alternate modalities of CMC were studied in both already-established and professional relationships, perhaps these results would have resembled those of the previously mentioned research.


Conclusions and Future Study


In order to gain a complete understanding of CMC’s true effect on both online and offline relationships, it is necessary to conduct a study that examines all aspects of
CMC. This includes, but is not limited to, email, IM, voice-chat, video-chat, online journals and diaries, online social groups with message boards, and chat rooms. The effects on relationships of each modality may be different, and this is demonstrated by
the discrepancies in intimacy between email and IM correspondence. As each mode of communication becomes more prevalent in individuals’ lives, it is important to examine the impact of all modes of CMC on online and offline relationship formation, maintenance, and even termination.

    Developed by philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin, the Toulmin
    method is a style of argumentation that breaks arguments down into six
    component parts:

    - claim
    - grounds
    - warrant
    - qualifier
    - rebuttal
    - backing.

    In Toulmin’s method, every argument begins with three fundamental parts:
    - the claim
    - the grounds
    - the warrant

    A claim is the assertion that authors would like to prove to their audience.
    It is, in other words, the main argument.

    The grounds of an argument are the evidence and facts that help support the claim.

    Finally, the warrant, which is either implied or stated explicitly,
    is the assumption that links the grounds to the claim.

    Backing refers to any additional support of the warrant.
    In many cases, the warrant is implied, and therefore the backing provides
    support for the warrant by giving a specific example that justifies the warrant.

    The qualifier shows that a claim may not be true in all circumstances.
    Words like “presumably,” “some,” and “many” help your audience understand
    that you know there are instances where your claim may not be correct.

    The rebuttal is an acknowledgement of another valid view of the situation.
